## 📂 Projects
- [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Tara-bot1/Tara/blob/main/Analysis_report%20(final).ipynb):
  Studies show that acquiring a new customer can cost 5–25 times more than retaining an existing one, which is why it is essential to predict customer churn.
  This project explores predictive modeling techniques to address customer churn in the banking sector. Using a dataset enriched with customer demographics and behaviour, three distinct machine learning approaches—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Neural Networks—were implemented and evaluated.
- [New York Yellow Taxi Operation Optimisation](https://github.com/Tara-bot1/Tara/blob/main/New%20York%20Yellow%20Taxi): 
  This project analyses New York Yellow Taxi data to provide actionable insights into improving operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and revenue generation. By     leveraging data on trip characteristics, fare structure, and dispatch patterns, we identified opportunities for optimising strategies and maximising profitability.
  - [Contoso Bussiness Decision Dashboard](https://github.com/Tara-bot1/Tara/blob/main/New%20York%20Yellow%20Taxi): 
  The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the office furniture and equipment industry, with revenue declines of 14.9% in furniture (IBISWorld) and 16.4% in equipment (Gartner) in 2020. Contoso, specialising in this sector, has tasked us with analysing their sales data to uncover insights and develop strategies for sustaining revenue and profitability in the evolving market.
